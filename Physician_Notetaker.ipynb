    "\n",
    "Doctor: Did you seek medical attention at that time?\n",
    "Patient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn’t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: How did things progress after that?\n",
    "Patient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really bad. I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n",
    "Patient: It’s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It’s nothing like before.\n",

    "Doctor: That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\n",
    "Patient: No, nothing like that. I don’t feel nervous driving, and I haven’t had any emotional issues from the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?\n",
    "Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn’t really stopped me from doing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: That’s encouraging. Let’s go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and there’s no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient: That’s a relief!\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctor: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I’d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.\n",

    "Patient: That’s great to hear. So, I don’t need to worry about this affecting me in the future?\n",
    "Doctor: That’s right. I don’t foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you’re on track for a full recovery.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### 1. How would you handle ambiguous or missing medical data in the transcript?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguous data is common in real-world clinical conversations.\n",
    "To handle this safely, I explicitly will mark missing information as \"Not mentioned\" instead of inferring or hallucinating values. For ambiguous cases, I use contextual rules and confidence-based checks rather than relying solely on model predictions. This ensures clinical reliability and avoids giving incorrect medical assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. What pre-trained NLP models would you use for medical summarization?\n",
    "\n",
    "For medical summarization, I would use domain-specific pre-trained models such as BioBERT or ClinicalBERT as they are trained on biomedical and clinical corpora. In this assignment, I focused on template-based summarization combined with medical NER to maintain explainability and reduce the risk of hallucination, which is important in healthcare NLP."

The training data would be annotated with sentiment labels such as anxious, neutral, and reassured. Fine-tuning would involve supervised learning with a classification head, using techniques like early stopping and class balancing to avoid overfitting.\n",

These datasets provide domain-specific language that improves sentiment detection accuracy compared to general-purpose sentiment datasets."

    "##### 1.How would you train an NLP model to map medical transcripts into SOAP format?\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an NLP model for SOAP note generation, I would use supervised learning with paired datasets consisting of medical transcripts and their corresponding SOAP notes. A sequence-to-sequence model such as T5 or BART could be fine-tuned to learn the mapping between unstructured dialogue and structured SOAP sections. Domain adaptation using clinical text would be critical for accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.What rule-based or deep-learning techniques would improve the accuracy of SOAP note generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy can be improved using a hybrid approach. Rule-based techniques help with deterministic section mapping and ensure clinical safety, while deep-learning models handle linguistic variability and summarization. Combining entity extraction, section classification, and controlled text generation provides a balance between accuracy, explainability, and robustness."
